# Medicine Dispenser Vending Machine

Welcome to the Medicine Dispenser Vending Machine project documentation! This project aims to provide a convenient solution for dispensing medicines using a vending machine connected to a Bluetooth-enabled device. Users can log in, scan their prescription QR code, make a payment, and receive their prescribed medicines. Additionally, users can view their purchase history on the website associated with the system.

## Introduction
The Medicine Dispenser Vending Machine project provides a seamless experience for users to obtain their prescribed medicines. By integrating hardware components like Arduino Uno, DC motors, and Bluetooth HC05, along with software components developed using MIT App Inventor and Firebase, this project ensures efficient medicine dispensing and user management.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can log in or sign up using a username and password.
- **Prescription Scanning:** Users can scan their prescription QR code using the vending machine's camera.
- **Payment Integration:** Once the prescription is scanned, users can make a payment through the vending machine interface.
- **Medicine Dispensing:** After successful payment, the vending machine dispenses the prescribed medicines.
- **Purchase History:** Users can view their purchase history on the project website.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno
- DC Motors
- Bluetooth HC05
- MIT App Inventor
- Firebase
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Hardware Setup
The hardware setup includes components such as Arduino Uno, DC motors for dispensing, Bluetooth HC05 for communication, a camera module for QR code scanning, and necessary connecting wires and nuts.

## Future Scope
- **Doctor Portal:** Expand the system to include a portal for doctors to digitally generate and sign QR prescriptions. This portal would streamline the prescription process and ensure authenticity, reducing the risk of misuse or errors.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement advanced encryption and authentication mechanisms to enhance the security of user data and transactions.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Introduce remote monitoring capabilities to allow healthcare providers to remotely track medicine dispensing and user interactions, enabling better patient care and management.
- **Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR):** Integrate the system with electronic health record systems to provide comprehensive patient information and improve healthcare coordination.
- **Smart Inventory Management:** Implement smart inventory management features to monitor medicine stock levels, automate reordering processes, and optimize inventory usage.
- **User Feedback and Analytics:** Incorporate feedback mechanisms and analytics tools to gather user feedback, analyze usage patterns, and continuously improve the system's performance and user experience.
- **Expand to Other Healthcare Services:** Explore opportunities to expand the system's capabilities to offer additional healthcare services, such as telemedicine consultations, appointment scheduling, or health monitoring.
- **Localization and Accessibility:** Customize the system to support multiple languages and ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, thereby reaching a broader audience and improving inclusivity.
